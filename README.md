Prompt the user to enter a country’s name, population, number of cases, number of deaths
and number of tests performed. This country’s data will be the reference country for John’s
analysis – the other countries will be compared based on this data.

Prompt the user for the number of countries which will be compared with the reference
country.

For each of the countries to be compared, the program should request the user to enter the
same data as the reference country. The following comparisons are then made with the
reference country:

o Size of population
o Cases per million (how many more or less compared to reference country)
o Deaths per million (how many more or less compared to reference country)
o Tests per million (how many more or less compared to reference country)
o Percentage of persons in the country who have died

When displaying the deaths per million of both countries, a graphical representation must be
given consisting of a set of stars on a line. A star is printed for every 50 deaths per million
persons.

Should also keep track of the following information which should be displayed
before the program terminates:

o The name of the country and the amount of cases for the country with the highest number of cases, per million. This includes the reference country.
o The name of the country and the amount of deaths for the country with the least number of deaths, per million. This includes the reference country.
